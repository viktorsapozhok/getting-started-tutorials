Z Shell
=======

Update the package repository cache of your Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system
and then install ZSH.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install zsh

Now set ZSH as the default login shell for the user youâ€™re logged in as with the following command.

.. code-block:: bash
